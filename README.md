# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression (ML Approach)

This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict house prices using various key features like area, bedrooms, parking, and more. It leverages **Multiple Linear Regression** to learn from historical housing data.

## 📂 Dataset Info
- **Filename:** `housing.csv`
- **Total Rows:** 545
- **Features:** 13 (Mix of numerical & categorical)
- The dataset includes fields such as `area`, `bedrooms`, `stories`, `parking`, and `furnishing status`.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🎯 Objectives
- Data Loading and Exploration
- Data Cleaning & Encoding of Categorical Variables
- Train-Test Split
- Apply **Multiple Linear Regression**
- Model Evaluation:
  - **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
  - **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)
  - **R² Score**

## 📊 Results Snapshot
- **Mean Absolute Error:** ~9.7 Lakhs
- **Mean Squared Error:** ~1.75 Trillion
- **R² Score:** 0.65 (Good fit)
